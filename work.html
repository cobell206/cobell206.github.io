                    Tesla was a great experience where I worked for the Service Engineering team to develop service procedures and service 
                    tooling. I first took apart the cars to come up with a quick and inexpensive way to diagnose thermal issues in Model S 
                    and X in the case a car comes in with an overheating error. Once finished, I helped develop some tooling to flush the 
                    A/C system that&#39s easy to use and portable. Lastly after fishing some other service tooling jobs, I helped look over 
                    Model 3 to see if there were any design issues we could induce before release to reduce service costs on the car. 
                    These changes were then sent back to the design teams to see if they could incorporate them into their designs.

                    My internship with Sargent started by doing environmental engineering to ensure the facilities were complying with 
                    local and national environmental laws. Once this was done, I then wrote up reoccurring checklists and inspections 
                    for the facilities manager to put in his Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS). Once the environmental 
                    work was done, I transitioned to manufacturing engineering where I worked on part routers and part handling. 
                    Additionally, I designed some part handing tooling but due to budget, it was never built. Once I graduated, I moved 
                    to the design office full time for three months where I helped design an actuator value, but ending up leaving the 
                    company for Tesla and my Masterâ€™s program.
